This algorithm takes a list of units and cross references it with the prioritized units list. Whichever units are on the prioritized list and the master list, the unit on the master list gets highlighted. Any unit that is on the prioritized list but not on the master list will be flagged and put on a separate page.(Highlight) Every highlighted unit is then moved onto 3 different pages based on the type of unit it is.(Print) Finally the amount of each unit is calculated on a separate excel sheet.(Calculate)
